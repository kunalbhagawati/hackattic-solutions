# Solutions for challenges in https://hackattic.com/challenges/

Each solution gets its own folder.
I've tried to keep the programming environment separate per answer too (`package.json`, etc).

# Requirements & Setup

These are a combined list of requirements, and are specific to each problem.
Not everything uses Python or Docker, for instance.

### Programming Languages:

- Python 3.9+
- NodeJS 17+

### Misc

- Docker

## Setup

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv  # set up the virtual environment for python
```

Individual setups for each problem will be in the readme inside the folder.
